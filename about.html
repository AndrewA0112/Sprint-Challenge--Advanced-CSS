                    <p>Some places we go are the moon. Thats the thing you can see in the sky sometimes. We go to the moon because it is different from earth, like a lot different, so you should go.</p>
                    <p>The moon is the picture on the right. Some others places we want to go like the moon are other planets are like mars, but thats much harder because its expensive, so pay us please.</p>

            <h3>Let's Go For A Walk</h3>
            <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.</p>
            <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
